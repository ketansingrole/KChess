<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are many great Chess software available, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I am creating this chess software. I want to create a Chess software so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need. A truly cross platform and open-source Chess software which will run on windows, Linux and Mac. This chess software aims to bring modern UI, a collection of great chess tools for learning and improving at this game.

Here's why:

- Your time should be focused on improving at chess. A project that solves a problem and helps others
- You should get a completely free cross platform Chess experience.
- A native software which can truly make use of you're hardware.
